"""
This module implements a lexicographic minimizer for blocks of bytes.

That is, given a block of bytes of a given size, and a predicate that accepts
such blocks, it tries to find a lexicographically minimal block of that size
that satisfies the predicate, by repeatedly making local changes to that
starting point.

Assuming it is allowed to run to completion (which due to the way we use it it
actually often isn't) it makes the following guarantees, but it usually tries
to do better in practice:

1. The lexicographic predecessor (i.e. the largest block smaller than it) of
   the answer is not a solution.
2. No individual byte in the solution may be lowered while holding the others
   fixed.
